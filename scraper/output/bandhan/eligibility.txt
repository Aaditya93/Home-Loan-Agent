# Bandhan Bank — Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria for Bandhan Bank Home Loans are as follows:

**For Suraksha/Sajavat/Suvidha Home Loan:**
- **Age:** Minimum 21 years; Maximum 75 years at the time of loan maturity or retirement age, whichever is earlier.
- **Income:** Surplus income or monthly disposable income is taken into consideration.

**For Su-awas Home Loan:**
- Exclusively for existing micro-banking borrowers who have completed a minimum of 1 full cycle of their loan.

**General Considerations:**
- Bandhan Bank may also consider the applicant's credit score and monthly income while assessing eligibility.
- While no specific cut-off credit score is stated, applicants with CIBIL scores of 750 and above typically have a higher chance of availing home loans at more favorable interest rates.
